## 📖 Description
The **Expense Tracker** is a simple C# (.NET 9) console application that helps users manage their daily expenses.  
It allows you to **add, view, edit, and delete expenses** — all stored locally in a **JSON file** instead of a SQL database.  

This makes the project lightweight, portable, and perfect for beginners who want to learn:
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
- File handling in C#  
- Organizing a project using models and services
